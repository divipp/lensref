= lensref-0.3 =

* Updated semantics which make possible onChange without an Eq constraint
  This semantics handles more tricky situations than the previous one.

Interface changes:

* Data.LensRef provides a restricted (and probably less confusing) interface
  The hidden functions can be accessed via Data.LensRef.Class
* Renamed onChange combinators
* onChange don't have the Eq constraint; there is an new onChangeEq function
  with the interface of the previous onChange function
* Most of the methods of the MonadRegister type class
  went to the MonadRefCreator type class
* Simplification: provide askPostpone instead of registerCallback
* Correction references (still experimental)

Implementation changes:

* Completed fast implementation
* Fast implementation was tuned for performance
  It is now just ~10 times slower than IORefs.
* The pure implementation is also quite fast now
  (but asymptotically slower than the fast implementation)
* More test cases
* Use Applicative instead of Monad in ReadRef where possible
* Eliminate lens dependency, use a compatible custom module instead

Documentation:

* Begin to write an introduction to state-based FRP (still under construction)
* graphviz support for documentation
* Added a criterion performance test

= lensref-0.2 =

* Do not always build tests
* 'cabal test' support
* Eliminate dependency on lens, operational and containers packages
* Add lower bound to transformers package dependency

Haddock fix

= lensref-0.1 =

Initial separated version.
The content of lensref was detached from the lgtk package on 10 May, 2014.

Compared to the previously announced version, lgtk-0.5.3, the changes are the following:

* Generalized and cleaned up interface
* Cleand up pure implementation
* First version of the fast implementation
* Switch from data-lens to Edward Kmett's lens library
* Upgrade to work with GHC 8.2
* Repository moved to GitHub

= lgtk-0.5.2 =

= lgtk-0.5.2 =

* Better support for references with equality
* Inner change: safer state handling with MVars

= lgtk-0.5.1 =

* Documentation fixes and cleanup

= lgtk-0.5 =

* Do not use monadic lenses any more.
* References with inherent identity (makes defining auto-sensitive buttons easier)
* Lots of inner changes.
